# The Virtual Food App

- This project is a food app that virually serves the user what they desire.
- The user is led to the first "page" where they need to enter their name into the form.
- If they submit an empty form, they will see an error message and the form input in red.
- One they submit their name into the form, it will the name save in the local storage, 
and their name will be displayed on the next (selection) page.
- If the user forgets to capitalize their name, it will automatically be capitalized for them.
- As long as that name is in the localstorage, the user will see the second page.
- On the 2nd page, once the user makes a selection, the program will dynamically serve the user
an image of a virtual food dish and display all their selections in text.
- If the user changes a selection, it will "restart".
- The user can reset the selection which will clear the selections, 
and reset the name which will lead them back to the first page and clear the username from localstorage.
- The site has a stylish design theme that is related to food
- The site is also mobile responsive
- The program has scalability and can work if more than 3 choices are added
